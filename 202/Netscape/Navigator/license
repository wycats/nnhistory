This Agreement has 3 parts.  Part I applies if you have not purchased
a license to the accompanying software (the "Software").  Part II
applies if you have purchased a license to the Software.  Part III
applies to all license grants.  If you initially acquired a copy of
the Software without purchasing a license and you wish to purchase a

PART I -- TERMS APPLICABLE WHEN LICENSE FEES NOT (YET) PAID (LIMITED
TO EVALUATION, EDUCATIONAL AND NON-PROFIT USE) GRANT.

of charge if (a) you are a student, faculty member or staff member of
an educational institution (K-12, junior college, college or library)
or an employee of an organization which meets Netscape's criteria for
a charitable non-profit organization; or (b) your use of the Software
is for the purpose of evaluating whether to purchase an ongoing\license 
to the Software.  The evaluation period for use by or on
behalf of a commercial entity is limited to 90 days; evaluation use by
others is not subject to this 90 day limit.  Government agencies
(other than public libraries) are not considered educational or
charitable non-profit organizations for purposes of this Agreement. If
you are using the Software free of charge, you are not entitled to
hard-copy documentation, support or telephone assistance.  If you fit
within the description above, you may use the Software in the manner
described in Part III below under "Scope of Grant."

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

warranty of any kind, including without limitation the warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
the Software is borne by you.  Should the Software prove defective,
you and not Netscape assume the entire cost of any service and
repair. In addition, the security mechanisms implemented by Netscape
software have inherent limitations, and you must determine that the
Software sufficiently meets your requirements. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of the agreement. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS
DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS
THAT VARY BY JURISDICTION.

PART II -- TERMS APPLICABLE WHEN LICENSE FEES PAID

GRANT. Subject to payment of applicable license fees, Netscape grants
to you a non-exclusive license to use the Software and accompanying
documentation ("Documentation") in the manner described in Part III
below under "Scope of Grant."

LIMITED WARRANTY.

Netscape warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date
of acquisition, the Software, if operated as directed, will
substantially achieve the functionality described in the
Documentation. Netscape does not warrant, however, that your use of
the Software will be uninterrupted or that the operation of the
Software will be error-free or secure. In addition, the security
mechanisms implemented by Netscape software have inherent limitations,
and you must determine that the Software sufficiently meets your
requirements.  Netscape also warrants that the media containing the
Software, if provided by Netscape, is free from defects in material
and workmanship and will so remain for ninety (90) days from the date
you acquired the Software. Netscape's sole liability for any breach of
this warranty shall be, in Netscape's sole discretion: (i) to replace
your defective media; or (ii) to advise you how to achieve
substantially the same functionality with the Software as described in
the Documentation through a procedure different from that set forth in
the Documentation; or (iii) if the above remedies are impracticable,
to refund the license fee you paid for the Software. Repaired,
corrected, or replaced Software and Documentation shall be covered by
this limited warranty for the period remaining under the warranty that
covered the original Software, or if longer, for thirty (30) days
after the date (a) of shipment to you of the repaired or replaced
Software, or (b) Netscape advised you how to operate the Software so
as to achieve the functionality described in the Documentation. Only
if you inform Netscape of your problem with the Software during the
applicable warranty period and provide evidence of the date you
purchased a license to the Software will Netscape be obligated to
honor this warranty. Netscape will use reasonable commercial efforts
to repair, replace, advise or, for individual consumers, refund
pursuant to the foregoing warranty within 30 days of being so
notified.

improper use; or if you violate the terms of this Agreement, then this

apply if the Software is used on or in conjunction with hardware or
software other than the unmodified version of hardware and software
