  <p><img src="sign.jpg" class="left" />My floor at work is having an
  office-decorating contest, and some friends of mine who work in a nearby room
  decided to use video games as the theme for their decorations. Among the video
  games they selected for display was a video game called <em>Portal</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Portal</em> has become something of a cult classic since it was
  released in 2007. Most players will instantly recognize the consistent and
  distinctive aesthetic that <em>Portal</em> uses to immerse the player in a
  world that is unconventional for first-person video games: the game takes
  place in a series of "test chambers", wherein an artificially-intelligent
  computer confronts the player with a series of puzzles, ostensibly with cake
  as a reward for solving all of them.</p>

  <p>One of the most dramatic presentations of this aesthetic is the large,
  fluorescent-lit signs that flicker to life as the player approaches the start
  of each chamber. Each sign shows which number test chamber the player is
  in, how far the player is through the testing sequence, and what hazards will
  and will not be present in the chamber.</p>
 
  <p><img src="inset.png" class="right" />Originally, the <em>Portal</em>
  office decorations were going to be small reproductions of the various hazard
  symbols stuck on surfaces around the room. When I saw them, I was disappointed
  at how low-quality they looked, so I offered to make some better
  <em>Portal</em>-themed decorations. Since all the rooms on the floor are
  numbered and there is a huge window into my friends' office from the hallway,
  it seemed appropriate to recreate the entire sign.</p>
  
  <p>This proved difficult for a variety of reasons. Notably, the image files
  the game uses to display the signs are much lower quality than would be
  necessary to print a life-size version, so I had to trace each one that I
  wanted to use in the sign (after quite a bit of difficulty finding the right
  files to trace in the first place).</p>

  <p><div class="left img"><div><a href="illustrations_large.jpg"
  ><img src="illustrations.jpg" /></a></div><div class="hint">Click for a
  larger view</div></div>I also created a number of original hazard symbols
  appropriate to our office in the style of the in-game artwork, which turned
  out to be at least as challenging as tracing the original graphics: many of
  the concepts I wanted to represent (like "computer programming") did not lend
  themselves to simple depiction, and people often disagreed about which
  candidate designs looked better. I went through several iterations of each
  new symbol, first drawing it by hand and then eyeballing a digital version
  using the same tools I used to trace the in-game graphics. Ultimately, I
  settled on this combination of new hazard symbols and reproductions of those
  seen in <em>Portal</em>:</p>
  
  <p class="img"><img src="symbols.png" /></p>
  
  <p>When it was all done, we were left with a three-foot-by-six-foot
  greyscale poster, which we taped to the inside of the glass in the office.
  Philipp, who works there, took this photo:</p>
  
  <p><div class="img"><div><a href="office_large.jpg"><img src="office.jpg"
  /></a></div><div class="hint">Click for a larger view</div></div></p>
  
  <p>There were many other small bits of art in the final design (which was
  produced from <a href="sign.svg">this file</a>), and many more photos from
  various points in the production process; but these were the most significant
  parts of the project.</p>
